# MildPorts: Zelda Sword Skills  

An old but very high quality mod for the time brought me a lot of fun as a kid. Zelda Sword Skills introduced custom combat mechanics, enemies, items, masks, NPCs... so much to have fun with as a kid.  
Unfortunately, the mod stopped being maintained in 1.8.9, meaning that a lot of potentially interesting mod combinations are now lost, and that newer audiences may never even know about the original mod.  
This, is why I decided to make this mod project.

## What will this revival project entail?

At the highest priority, the project will consist of recreating the vast majority of the original mod's features and content with as much fidelity as possible. (Scratch-Alpha Stage) <--- We're here!   
Once the original mod is recreated in a relatively bug free state that runs decently, it will be, if possible, given a Fabric port and have potential compatibility issues worked on. (Beta Stage | Once finished: Release Stage of the "Legacy" Versions)    
After this, certain of the mod's features will be modernized, changed, or added onto, with Legacy versions entering Long Term Support. (Early release stages of the "Modern" Versions)  

### I'm not sure I understand, what will the difference between Legacy and Modern be?  

Legacy: Strictly a forward port of the original mod's last version, with no added features and only the minimal amount of feature changes necessary to make it function well within the modern Minecraft environment.  

Modern: A personal continuation of the mod, including things such as *proper* dungeons, bossfights, extra items, and so on as potential features.  


## Are you even allowed to do this?  
The original mod's [GitHub repository]([url](https://github.com/coolAlias/ZeldaSwordSkills)) bears the GNU GPL 3.0 License. As to best fit the demands of that license, this project will remain open source and will reuse the same license.  
If you believe that I have infringed upon any mod, party, or otherwise entity's license or rights during this project, please open an issue about it.  


## I've heard of other Zelda mods, will these be compatible? Is there a collaboration or competition?  
The main other Zelda mod, Legendary Armory, is a mod I love. However, as its code does not have any permissive license, I will refrain from using any of its original content. I very much recommend you check it out too!  
As for compatibility, that's currently a question I can't answer, as I'd need to get permission and to do a lot of work to create a compatibility layers.
