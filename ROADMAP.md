## Alpha Stage -- (WE'RE HERE)
The Alpha Stage aims to recreate the most important elements of ZSS, the current plans of the Alpha Stage are:  
* Skills System, including all the ZSS skills and the custom lockon system and other custom combat elements.
* Majority of armors and swords
* NPCs, most key items
* Dungeons
* Masks
* Majority of Misc. features  

The goal is to at minimum lay down the vast majority of the framework for Legacy versions. That is to say versions which will be purely forwardports with new features and content changes kept to the absolute minimum possible. It is important to try and make the Legacy Framework as flexible and easy to understand, read and reuse as possible. Ideally, Legacy Edition should be portable to not just 1.21+ NeoForged, but previous major versions of modding with regard to Forge and Fabric.  


## Beta Stage  
The Beta Stage will consist of bug-fixing, optimizing and fine tuning the Legacy Version of the ZSS port. This includes technicalities such as:
* Built-in Antique Atlas compatibility
* Misc. potential compatibility issues
* Framework for other modded items to be recognized as swords by the Skills System
* Finishing up the Skills Framework and releasing it as an isolated library mod for other modders to use.

Other important elements include:
* Documenting the code and mod properly
* Ensuring as much compatibility as possible with common optimization mods (e.g. Sodium), if external libraries were used, trying to minimize the usage of external libraries
* Attempting a Fabric Port, and if that is possible, switching to a multiplatform base
* Starting the development of the "Modern", AKA "Continuation" Versions. These versions will be personal continuations of the mod aiming to implement more modern Minecraft and Modding features and understandings to improve and expand on the mod's original features.  

Once the Legacy Versions reach an achieved state, they should be put on Long Term Support (LTS) consisting of porting the Legacy Version, and implementing bug fixes and optimizations where it is not too time-inefficient to do so.  

Once a fully functional Continuation Version is built, with minimal bugs and relatively good performance and compatibility, it is possible to move past the Beta Stage.  


## Release Stage and Beyond  

The Release Stage and beyond will consist of continuing the porting, bug fixing and optimizations of both versions in this project.  
It will also be the stage where the features of Continuation Versions keep improving and expanding, with the following main ideas as vague projects:  
* Fully fleshed out dungeons, with in part unique enemies and puzzles. With a distinct and unique boss fight
* New Biomes or structures reminiscent of Zelda Games (Death Mountain, Kokiri Forest, etc.)
* Extra equipment and items that did not make it into the original ZSS mod.
* Misc. Features and improvements that could be made from the modernized framework.
